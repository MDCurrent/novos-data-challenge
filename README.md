# Novum Pharma Data Analysis Challenge

### The Challenge

  Show us something interesting using the provided dataset. You may use any
  tool/programming language of your choice so long as that tool is available
  for free (you may assume we have Microsoft Office). The use of additional,
  external datasets is welcomed, but not required.

  Examples of interesting analyses include (but are not limited to):
  
    - How effective is occupation as a predictor of whether a person will
      enjoy an action film?
    - Are there generalizations that can be made regarding opinions of films
      released at different points in the viewer's life?

  How you choose to convey your findings is completely up to you.
  Examples include: a Word document containing a written account of the
  analysis, a Power Point slide deck, a website, a Jupyter Notebook, etc.

### About the dataset

  The dataset you will be using is the MovieLens 100K Dataset. This dataset
  contains 100,000 movie ratings from 1000 users on 1700 films. It was compiled
  by the University of Minnesota during a seven-month time period between
  September 19th, 1997 and April 22nd, 1998. More information on the dataset
  can be found in the README, located here:
  http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k-README.txt.

  The data can be downloaded through the following url:

### Time limit

  You have 48 or 72 hours to complete your analysis depending on whether you
  choose to work on the weekend or weeknights, respectively. This short time
  period is not meant to intimidate; rather, it is meant to be a reflection of
  our expectations for the depth of analysis in this challenge. We're not
  expecting academic-level research--just enough to make us say, "Hmm, that's
  interesting." The total time spent on this challenge should be around 6 to 8
  hours, though more or less is fine.

### Delivering your results

  Before the end of your 48 hours, please reply to this email with one of the
  following:
  
    - (Preferred) A link to a GitHub repo containing all findings, presentation
      materials, and code used in this challenge. If you choose this method, 
      please fork this repo and complete your work in the forked repo.
    - A zip file (no larger than 25MB) containing all finding, presentation
      materials, and code used in this challenge.

  Additionally, your zip file/repo should contain a file called "README.md"
  which explains where your findings can be found and how to reproduce your
  analysis.

### Post-analysis questions

  On your interview day, you will meet with a member of the Novum Pharma team
  to discuss your analysis. Be prepared to answer the following questions
  during this time:
  
    - If given more time what else would you do?
    - Why did you use the tools you used?
    - How would your approach change if the data set contained 1 billion
      ratings? Which tools would you use?
    - Let’s say that you wanted to reproduce your analysis on a regular
      basis—-say, once a week in perpetuity. How would you accomplish this?
